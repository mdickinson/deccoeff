Deccoeff is an extension type for Python 3.0 that implements
nonnegative decimal integers.  These integers can be used in
arithmetic in the usual way and also treated as strings of decimal
digits.  The main purpose of Deccoeff is to act as the coefficient
type for Decimal instances.

All questions, comments, suggestions, etc., should go to Mark
Dickinson at dickinsm@gmail.com.

This distribution also contains a version of decimal.py that's adapted
to use the Deccoeff type, along with all the decimal tests for testing
purposes.


Installation instructions (unix)
--------------------------------

(1) Edit the top line of the Makefile to point to a Python 3.x
executable.

(2) ./configure && make

(3) make install

Then from Python you can type:


Usage
-----

To get started, just import Deccoeff from deccoeff

>>> from deccoeff import *
>>> D = Deccoeff

Deccoeffs can be created from integers, strings, or other Deccoeffs:

>>> D(2)
Deccoeff('2')
>>> D('1234')
Deccoeff('1234')
>>> D()
Deccoeff('0')
>>> D(D(314159))
Deccoeff('314159')

Arithmetic works as expected, except that if the result of an
arithmetic operation would be negative then OverflowError is raised.

>>> D(23)**D(12)
Deccoeff('21914624432020321')
>>> D(1729) - D(729)
Deccoeff('1000')
>>> D(729) - D(1729)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
OverflowError: difference is negative

Deccoeff instances play nicely with other integer types, giving
a Deccoeff result.

>>> D(1234567) % 100
Deccoeff('67')

There's an upper bound on the number of decimal digits a Deccoeff
can have;  it's made available to Python as deccoeff.MAX_DIGITS.

>>> print(MAX_DIGITS)
1000000000
>>> x = D(1) << (MAX_DIGITS - 1)  # fine
>>> y = D(1) << MAX_DIGITS
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
OverflowError: Deccoeff instance has too many digits

A Deccoeff instance can be indexed and sliced to give an easy way to
extract a subset of its digits.  Note that indexing works from a
mathematical perspective: x[0] refers to the units digit of x, x[1]
refers to the tens digit, and so on.  Thus in the usual representation
of a nonnegative integer as a decimal string, x[0] is the *last* digit
printed, not the first.  The builtin function len, when applied to a
Deccoeff, gives the number of decimal digits needed to print that
Deccoeff, or 0 if the Deccoeff instance is zero.

>>> x = D(314159265357989323)
>>> x
Deccoeff('314159265357989323')
>>> x[10:]
Deccoeff('31415926')
>>> x[1]
Deccoeff('2')
>>> x[:5]
Deccoeff('89323')
>>> x[5:]
Deccoeff('3141592653579')
>>> len(x)
18

Note however that the start and stop arguments to the slice must be
nonnegative, and that the step argument is not supported.

As you'd expect for a decimal type, the shift operators multiply and
divide by powers of 10, not 2.

>>> x >> 10
Deccoeff('31415926')
>>> x << 10
Deccoeff('3141592653579893230000000000')

Internally, a Deccoeff instance is stored as an array of coefficients
in base 10**LIMB_DIGITS, for some value of LIMB_DIGITS.  While there's
little reason for the user to care about the value of LIMB_DIGITS, it
can be accessed as deccoeff.LIMB_DIGITS.

>>> LIMB_DIGITS
9
